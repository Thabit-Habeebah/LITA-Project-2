## Data cleaning and preparation
- Microsoft Excel
    * For Data loading and preparation:Here, I Used CTRL+A to select the entire table,ALT+H+O+I to autofit the columns which could also be done by writing some lines of code and also ALT+A+M to remove duplicates.I did all this before exporting my data to Power BI for cleaning

 - Power BI(Power Query)
     * For Data Cleaning : Power BI already fixed the data type for me, then i went on to insert a custom column to multiply the unit price with the quantity sold to get the revenue derived from each product each day,I had to duplicate the "OrderDate" column to split the date into years, months, and days.
       I moved to the canvas to build my dashboard
       
- Just before I built my dashboard I exported my data to SQL Server for data quering,where I was trying to derive the total revenue fro each region and each products
         
- Microsoft Power BI
     * For Visualization
